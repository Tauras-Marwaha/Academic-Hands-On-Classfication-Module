# Academic-Hands-On-Classfication-Module
A Hands on academic exercise around the fundamentals of different classification algorithms.

Language: Python 3

Course: Intelligent Data Analysis (CS 6052) taught by Dr. Gowtham Atluri

Goal: Learn, implement, evaluate and reason out the results of different classification algorithms - **Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, SVM (Linear and non-linear), K Nearest Neighbours, Ensemble method (Bagging).**

Data: Multiple datasets with two classes.

Approach: We have been provided with datasets and interesting questions that needs to be answered by understanding the fundamentals of different algorithms. A sample practice module was also provided by the professor to guide us with some sample codes and help us getting started.

Acknowledgement: This assignment was designed by Dr. Gowtham Atluri as a part of requirement for CS 6052 - Intelligent Data Analysis course, taught at the University of Cincinnati.

Score: 10/10
